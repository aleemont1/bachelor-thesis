	note = {This paper provides an overview of a system developed to meet the needs of telemetry systems for use in university-designed sounding rockets. The telemetry and command system operates over a full-duplex 900 MHz link at altitudes up to 100 km, the typical max altitude achieved by university sounding rockets, using a lower data rate than the down-link for a reliable command up-link. As these missions become more prolific and with increasingly valuable payloads, without an increase in budget, there is a growing need for such data systems that are at the typical cost of hobbyist level rockets. This project is the development of a system that reduces mission risk by downloading health and sensor data in real-time, increases operator safety and redundancy by providing the ability to trigger an immediate abort option to save the vehicle, and improves system feedback through a software package that displays and analyzes the flight data, in real-time, to the operators at the ground station.},

	note = {This paper describes a telemetry system for a high-powered rocket entered in the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition hosted by the Experimental Sounding Rocket Association. On-board the rocket GPS coordinates,acceleration, magnetic ﬁeld and lux readings are collected,along with other data. The data is sent between internal systems using commercial Internet-of-Things boards that utilize IEEE 802.11 wireless protocols. The aggregated data is transmitted to a ground station through a monopole transmitting antenna and custom designed helical receiving antenna such that in the event of a crash, data is not lost. The ground station data recovery is performed using a commercial XBee transceiver, before being displayed in real time for tracking and safety purposes,and stored for future data analysis. The target apogee is 9 km, so real time GPS data will be useful for both tracking and vehicle recovery operations.},
